## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

So first of all i really loved this project it was fun and i was capable of learning a lot.
- I really liked that the position of the elements on the phone design were in diferent order then in a PC, it was a good challenge to figure out how to do it. 
- I tried to use as much comments as i could so my code is easier to understand.
- the most difficult thing for me in this project was to make the image responsive, i put the image in a div and then in a picture tag and i just couldnt wrap my head around it, how to make the image scale, but in the end i figured it out and learned a lot.
- the JS side was nothing hard, i just had to make sure that the email was valid and that the input was not empty.
- i am sure that there are better ways to do this project, but i am happy with the result.

### Continued development

i dont plan to add anything more to this project. I think it's finished and i'm happy with it. I will continue to learn and practice with new projects.
